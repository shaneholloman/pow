# Potential Test Coverage Gaps

This document outlines edge cases and scenarios that are not currently covered by the test suite but could potentially affect the tool's behavior in real-world usage.

## Purpose

This serves as a reference for:

- Future test development priorities
- Known limitations to be aware of when using the tool
- Areas that may need additional validation in production environments

## Git Operation Scenarios

### Merge Conflicts

**Status:** Not tested

The current test suite does not cover scenarios where:

- Main branch has diverged significantly from feature branch
- Automatic fast-forward merge fails due to conflicts
- User intervention is required to resolve merge conflicts

### Detached HEAD States

**Status:** Not tested

No testing for situations where:

- Repository is in detached HEAD state
- Tool behavior when not on a named branch
- Recovery from detached HEAD scenarios

### Submodule Scenarios

**Status:** Not tested

Edge cases involving:

- Repositories with git submodules
- Submodule updates during branch switching
- Nested repository structures

### Unusual Branch Names

**Status:** Not tested

Branch names containing:

- Special characters (spaces, unicode, symbols)
- Very long branch names
- Names that conflict with git references

## Package Manager Edge Cases

### Lockfile Corruption

**Status:** Not tested

Scenarios involving:

- Corrupted or malformed lockfile content
- Missing lockfiles when package.json indicates dependencies
- Lockfile format version mismatches

### Network and Installation Failures

**Status:** Not tested

Error handling for:

- Network failures during dependency installation
- Package registry unavailability
- Insufficient disk space during installation
- Permission issues with package installation

### Monorepo and Workspace Scenarios

**Status:** Not tested

Complex project structures:

- Yarn/npm/pnpm workspaces
- Monorepo configurations
- Multiple package.json files in subdirectories

## Platform-Specific Scenarios

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Status:** Limited testing

Areas needing broader validation:

- Windows-specific path handling and command behavior
- Different shell environments and terminal capabilities
- Various git configuration setups across platforms

### Git Configuration Variations

**Status:** Not tested

Different git setups:

- Non-standard git configurations
- Custom merge tools and diff tools
- Different authentication methods (SSH keys, tokens, etc.)

## Performance and Scale

### Large Repository Scenarios

**Status:** Not tested

Behavior with:

- Repositories with extensive history
- Large numbers of branches
- Very large files or binary assets

## Recommendations

1. **Incremental Testing**: Add tests for these scenarios as they become relevant or as issues are reported
2. **Real-World Validation**: Test with actual production repositories in controlled environments
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from early users about edge cases encountered
4. **Platform Testing**: Consider CI testing across multiple platforms and git versions

## Contributing

When encountering edge cases not covered here:

1. Document the scenario in this file
2. Create a test case if possible
3. Update the main test suite with the new coverage
